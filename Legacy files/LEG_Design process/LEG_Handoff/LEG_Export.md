## Promotional graphic assets for App Store and Play Store

To publish an app, we need to create promotional images or videos for the **App Store** and/or **Play Store**. Each platform has a specific set of requirements, so these graphics must be made accordingly.

### App Store

The App Store shows promo images according to the device you are viewing it from. That is why we need to create App Store images previewing the app for different devices. 

You can find the [list of devices and their corresponding static screenshot sizes here.](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devd274dd925) 
If you create a [promo video, follow these guidelines](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev4e413fcb8). 

### Goole Play Store

The [requirements for Play Store](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1078870?hl=en) are a bit simpler, especially for **static images**.

As for the **video**, you can add a promotional YouTube video within your gallery.
