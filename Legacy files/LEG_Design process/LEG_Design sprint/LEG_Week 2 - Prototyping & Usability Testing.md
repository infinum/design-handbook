After these intensive few days, it's time to translate all that you've talked about in the workshop to a clickable [prototype](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/prototype) ready for [usability testing](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/usability-testing).

Use Monday - Wednesday for prototyping and preparation, and book 1hour testing sessions on Thursday and Friday.

It's best if one designer focuses on the screens and the prototype while the other keeps their focus on organizing the usability testing.

These prototypes don't need to be polished; they have to work correctly to get the impression and suggestions from the users.

Use the beginning of Week 3 to collect all the necessary information and create a design sprint and usability testing report.
