**A qualitative and evaluative research method.**

Usability testing is a direct way of seeing how users interact with our product.

In usability testing, we show the clickable prototype to one user at a time (whether it's a mobile or web app), and we ask them to:
a. figure out what it is
b. try to use the prototype to do a typical task
c. find some critical information.

In moderated usability testing, you guide participants through specific tasks and scenarios while observing their actions, listening to their feedback, and asking follow-up questions.

Usability Testing is crucial because it can help us learn if our product is really based on users' behaviours and expectations. This leads to many ideas for improving the design. We usually perform ‚Äútask testing‚Äù ‚Äî we ask the user to do complete a task, and then we observe how well they do.

It's a bit like having a conversation with the user as they explore and provide insights on what works well and what needs improvement.

### Preparing tasks

After the client approved the agenda and after the responsibilities are assigned, the facilitator starts to prepare tasks and prototype(s). Be wary of the wording you're using on tasks; you don't want to give away the answer by mentioning the exact copy that is visible on the screen. For a more in-depth study of this process, take a look at [NNG‚Äôs guide](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/).

### Test Run

Before the official user sessions, it's crucial to conduct a test run to identify any smaller issues and possible improvements. Simulate the test in Infinum‚Äôs offices or via a video call. The participants should ideally include the user, the facilitator, and the observer.

### Moderating sessions

For each usability testing, we need at least two persons to set everything up:
a. facilitator,
b. observer.

This can a combination of produst strategists, designers, QAs or PMs. If you are the lead designer on the project, don‚Äôt take the user feedback personally and avoid bias towards users‚Äô opinions.

Here are some tips and tricks to get you started:
- In the beginning, **make sure the user feels comfortable and calm**. Be friendly, so the user feels relaxed, but not too friendly because we need to get objective answers and opinions from them. 
- Next, **we use a script with Interview guides to conduct usability testing**, and always keep the text in front of you. Don‚Äôt hesitate to read from it, but it‚Äôs ok to ad-lib a little, even if it means making mistakes. When the users see that you are comfortable making mistakes, it helps take the pressure off them.
- You have to **make it clear before you start that nothing we do or say is personal**, and they can always ask questions. It's helpful to tell them that sometimes giving the answers too soon will affect the testing, and you will wait until the end of the session to answer their questions. It‚Äôs important to mention this because it will seem rude not to answer their questions as you go along. If you want honest answers, it can be useful to point out you did not work on this project (whether that‚Äôs true or not) and that you are just overseeing the testing.
- **Double-check if the participant has signed recording consent and NDA**. If they did, turn on the recording of the session.
- If the participant's a bit quiet, it's ok to ask questions like ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat do you think‚Ä¶‚Äù. Try not to start a conversation, but just to remind them to think out loud. Talking too much at inappropriate times or leading the user can affect what they do and say, which can ruin the research findings.
- Ask participants not to refresh their browser or go back in browser's navigation. This might affect Maze's tracking of their behavior.
- When users finish the study in Useberry (they'll get "Thank you" screen), ask them follow-up questions.
- Tell users how they'll get their reward, e.g., you'll send voucher code via email.
