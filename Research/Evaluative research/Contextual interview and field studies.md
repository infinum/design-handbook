**A qualitative and generative method.**

Contextual interviews, also referred to as field studies, are research methods used in UX design and qualitative research to understand **how people use products and services in real-life situations**. This involves speaking with users while observing them in their natural environments to gather insights into their specific needs, behaviors, and challenges.

In contextual interviews, you **observe users in environments where they commonly use the product or service**, such as a home or workplace. You ask questions, observe their actions, and learn about their experiences and preferences. Your goal is to better understand how the user's environment affects their interactions.

Field studies go a step further. You’ll spend more time with users, observing them in their everyday settings. You take part in activities, take notes, and even capture photos or videos to better understand the user's context and experiences.

These methods have some great advantages. They provide genuine insights into how users really behave and what they need. By seeing users in action, you can **understand the factors that shape a user’s experiences**. You also collect lots of qualitative data, like personal stories and observations, which help identify patterns and inform design recommendations. Ultimately, these methods help create user-centered designs that truly empathize with users.
