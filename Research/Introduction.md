User research is the practice of **understanding users' needs, behaviors, and motivations** through a variety of methods, such as interviews, surveys, and usability testing. It is an essential part of the design process, helping to ensure that products and services are designed for the people who will use them.

User research can be used to answer a wide range of questions, such as:

- Who are my users?
- What are their needs and goals?
- How do they use my product or service?
- What are their pain points?
- What are their preferences?
- How can I improve my product or service to meet their needs?

User research can be conducted at any stage of the design process, but it is most valuable when done early on. This allows you to gather insights that can inform your design decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

There are many different methods of user research, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The best method for you will depend on your specific needs and goals. Some common methods include:

- **Interviews**: One-on-one conversations with users to understand their needs, goals, and experiences.
- **Surveys**: Quantitative data collection tool that can be used to gather information from a large number of users.
- **Usability testing**: Observational study of users as they interact with a product or service.
- **Card sorting**: A technique for understanding how users organize information.
