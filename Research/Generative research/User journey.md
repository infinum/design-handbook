## As-is user journey

An as-is user journey provides a visual representation of **the steps, touchpoints, and interactions** that a user goes through when engaging with a digital product or service. It captures the user's actions, thoughts, emotions, and pain points at each stage of their journey. By mapping out the as-is user journey, you can gain insights into the existing user experience, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for enhancement.

As-is user journey doesn’t show the desired state of UX, but the current one. Don’t mix it up with the desired user journey because both client and our internal team will start jumping from two mindsets: exploration and solutionizing.

A good as-is user journey should have:

- **A clearly defined scope**: you need to know when a journey starts and ends.
- **All user touchpoints**:  where users interact with the digital product or service. These touchpoints can include website visits, app interactions, customer support interactions, and more. 
- **Context of each touchpoint**: a visual representation of the user journey, highlighting each step and touchpoint along the way. Include key actions, emotions, thoughts, and pain points experienced by the user at each stage.
- **Opportunities and risks at each touchpoint**: identify opportunities you can leverage and potential risks you’ll need to mitigate as you’re creating the new product

Service blueprint is an extension of user journey. It shows the **inner workings of the client's organization that enables these user journeys**. Similar to the association between a steering wheel and dashboard, and all engine parts under the hood. A service blueprint provides a detailed overview of the various components involved in delivering the service or app, including both front-stage and back-stage activities.

## Service blueprint

A service blueprint follows a similar mapping blueprint (pun intended) as the user journey. You need to:

- **Define the Service Boundaries**: Clearly define the boundaries of the service being provided. Determine the starting and ending points of the service/product delivery process.
- **Identify Service Components**: Identify all the components involved in delivering the service, including customer-facing elements and back-stage (internal) processes. This can include activities such as customer interactions, technology systems, support processes, and any 3rd parties involved.
- **Map those insights into a single visual**: Create a visual representation of the service blueprint, organizing the various components in a sequential manner. Indicate the interactions, inputs, and outputs at each stage of the service.
- **Highlight Pain Points and Opportunities**: Look for opportunities to streamline processes, enhance communication, or introduce new technology solutions to enhance the overall service experience.
