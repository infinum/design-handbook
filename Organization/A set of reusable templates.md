When starting with the design phase on a new project, we usually go with one of our template files, so we don't have to create everything from scratch.

In [this Figma project](https://www.figma.com/files/project/3948296/Project-Styleguides) you can find templates for websites and web apps, mobile apps, discovery workshop and basic animations.

We didn't create these templates as project libraries, so to use them, please duplicate them as new files and move them to your project in Figma.

All of the templates are still WIP, so any feedback or upgrades are more than welcome.


### [Website and web app project template ↗︎](https://www.figma.com/file/fwGZT5Gj7YDw4E3y1JFZre/Web-Styleguide?node-id=1625%3A113362)

In this template, you can find a complete web project styleguide with font styles set for desktop, tablet and mobile, color and shadow styles.

This template also has a set of reusable components which you can use in the wireframe phase and keep as a solid foundation for the UI phase.

Other useful stuff in the template:

- layouts and grids for desktop, tablet and mobile
- favicon template
- Open Graph image template for posting the website on social media
- Tone&Voice styleguide

### [Ant.design web admin interface project template ↗︎](https://www.figma.com/file/SWwaQng1RltVTbFPEyoqy2/Ant-Design-UI-Kit-1.2-v4-update?node-id=410%3A31376)

<p align="center"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FSWwaQng1RltVTbFPEyoqy2%2FAnt-Design-UI-Kit-1.2-v4-update%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

Sometimes you will need to design an administrative interface (admin dashboard or back office) with ant.design.

[Ant.design](https://ant.design/) is a framework for creating simple design and development solutions for clients who will use this interface for internal use only, or for just a few customers outside of their organization.

In this case, you will use our ant.design template which gets occasionally updated with new styles and components.

We also organized this template as a styleguide and a set of components which you can use with limited modifications to create a custom interface for the client.

This template comes with a light and dark theme components. In the duplicated file, choose a theme for your project and delete the other one.

When you're designing with ant, remember that the focus is mostly on the UX, while framework elements provide UI solutions.

### [Mobile app project template ↗︎](https://www.figma.com/file/JP7rPVYzQXc7MCtlWZ8X72/Mobile-Styleguide?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/JP7rPVYzQXc7MCtlWZ8X72/Mobile-Styleguide?node-id=0%3A1))

<p align="center"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FJP7rPVYzQXc7MCtlWZ8X72%2FMobile-Styleguide%3Fnode-id%3D77%253A1&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

This template also contains a styleguide and components for your next iOS and/or Android app.

In the template, you can find the latest standard platform components which you can use to create new wireframes for your mobile project.

You can keep the styles and the structure of the file as a solid foundation for the upcoming UI phase.

Some useful stuff in the template:

- Styleguide adjusted to fit both iOS and Android needs/rules
- App screenshot template for App Store and Play Store
- Featured graphic template for Play Store
- App icon template for Android and iOS
- iOS components in light and dark mode

### [Interaction styleguide ↗︎](https://www.figma.com/file/YCDdaMiHHl7NMh7j8D0yku/Interaction-library-WIP?node-id=188%3A102)

<p align="center"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FYCDdaMiHHl7NMh7j8D0yku%2FInteraction-template-WIP%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A9&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

At some point in the project, you will need to define animations and transitions to create a rich user experience for the users.

The task is quite challenging, for designers and developers, so we've created this interaction styleguide to help you define and point out places in the app or website where these interactions occur.

You can also use some of our defaults for loading states, pressed states, hover states etc.

### [Remote discovery workshop template ↗︎](https://www.figma.com/file/djT2s2cKOLUPuWvBQTEU58/Remote-workshops-template?node-id=0%3A1)

<p align="center"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FdjT2s2cKOLUPuWvBQTEU58%2FRemote-workshops-template%3Fnode-id%3D10%253A570&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
If you're organizing a remote discovery workshop, this template will help you set up the activity list, keep notes, agreements and conclusions, all in one place.

### [Basic icon set: Feather Icons ↗︎](https://www.figma.com/file/3f3aVPf2LrTnkTDbWLOL7V/Basic-Icon-Set?node-id=25%3A5)

<p align="center"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F3f3aVPf2LrTnkTDbWLOL7V%2FBasic-Icon-Set%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

You don't need to draw new icons every time you start wireframing the UX. You can use this icon set and later, if necessary, replace them with custom icons in the UI phase.
