## Overview of Maze

[Maze](https://maze.design/) is one of your tools for [conducting usability testing](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/usability-testing). It's a user testing platform that uses your clickable prototype to get actionable insights from real users. 

Maze works with **prototypes for desktop, mobile or tablet apps**. You can import the prototypes from Figma, Invision, Marvel or Sketch, by copying the URL of the prototype. Then you create missions (tasks) and pose questions to see how the users react to your product.

<br>After the testing, you get a UX report based on the participants behavior within the prototype and the answers they've given. You can choose: if you like looking at spreadsheets you can get .csv file with results; if you like vibrantly **visualised and interactive results**, you can click on report Maze has prepared for you.

Creating a Maze is a mid-game move. You'll first have to cover the foundations of [usabiltiy testing](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/usability-testing) by doing these three:
<br>1. Defining **research goals** and checking with the client if they're ok with it
<br>2. Defining **user tasks** that would allow you to achieve research goals
<br>3. Preparing a **Figma prototype** that lets you do 1. and 2.

For 1. and 2. please read chapter about [usabiltiy testing](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/usability-testing). Wow, this a third time we're mentioning this "usability testing" thing, it must be important, right? In case you missed previous three links, here's [another LINK](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/usability-testing). Maze will make much more sense if you understand what's it for.

## Preparing Figma prototype

### Build prototype in a fresh Figma file
Big Figma file means slow loading time of your Maze. In extreme cases, it might cause your Maze to crash. The reason? Maze loads up all the viusals in the file regardless of whether they're in protoype or not.

### Untangle different tasks' flows
Trust us on this: If you have two or more intersecting flows, participants will find it and cross to the part of the product you didn't want them to see yet. In Maze there's no "Restart task" button, so if participants got stuck somewhere and can't get back to current task's flow -- they are stuck and can't get back to current task's flow. They'll need to give up on that task.
<br>How to tackle that? Seperate flows in prototype. If it's neccessary, make three homepages, each for different flow/task. Maze let's you set a different starting screen for each task so participants won't know that you got three homepages.

### Add hints
You're not testing users' recall of tasks instructions, but whether or not they can perform these tasks. On some screens it might make sense to give participatns a little hint about what they're supposed to choose among different options. Make your hints distinct so that users to confuse them for part of UI.

### Keep it real
Most participants won't notice your designs aren't pixel-perfect, but they'll notice illogical amounts, names, and changes from screen to screen. People get fixated on these things, which makes their feedback less useful. Try to check these three boxes:
- **Consistent information on all screens (names, phone numbers, payment amounts, language, etc.),**
- Realistic information the real user would have (don’t put just one obvious item or too many options to choose from in a screen),
- Working links for most of the buttons that are usually clickable.

## Setting up your Maze

### Import your prototype
You'll need to create a new project. If we've reached the limit of active projects, ping colleagues in #maze Slack channel, and check which projects can be archived. It's hard to miss the input box where you should copy/paste your protoype's link. It will take Maze a few moments to load everything app and you're ready to roll.

You should to the testing before the product has fully formed, using the wireframes or partially developed app. The primary purpose is to test the concept and build upon the initial framework. By doing that you’re saving time and money because you can do necessary iterations relatively quickly. You can test any flow, as long as you’re able to explain the requirements to the participants.




### Making your Maze

Paste the link to your prototype, name your new project and start creating your ﬁrst Maze project.

Now start adding blocks!

###Missions

- You are creating the path through which the user has to go to complete the mission.
- There can be one or more paths to completing the mission.

###Questions

- Opinion scale, multiple-choice, open questions, etc.
- You can edit the details for all of them

- Publish your Maze live

###Important details

- Always make a copy of your maze before publishing it!
- Give a short intro about the project - it’s easier to test if users have some context.
- Try to mix up the questions, so they don’t get bored easily.
- It’s good to have a few questions (yes/no, opinion scale, etc.) after every mission to get more info about how users think and why they do something.

###Analyze the findings

- Summarizing and organizing the results is one of the most important steps
- Don’t rush and double-check the prototype for errors.
- Don’t assume users will behave in certain way.

###Info that you can get from Maze

- Direct success, indirect success and bounce rate on each mission.
- Heat maps
- Clicks (also ﬁltered by 1st, 2nd, 3rd…) and areas of your choice.
- Time spent on a single mission.
- Feedback on questions.
- Misclick rate.
- Individual user behaviour.

###When in doubt...

...visit [Maze Help Center](https://help.maze.design/en/) (specifically their [Usability Testing](https://maze.design/guides/usability-testing) article) or ask a colleague (Design or QA) who worked in Maze before.
