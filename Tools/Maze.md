[Maze](https://maze.design/) is a user testing platform that turns your prototype into actionable insights from real users. It allows you to create missions and questions to see how the users react to your app. After the testing, you get a UX report based on the data you’ve collected.

Maze works with prototypes for desktop, mobile or tablet apps. Thanks to link sharing you can view the tests in any browser and on any device. You can import the prototypes from Figma, Invision, Marvel or Sketch. When the testing is complete, you’ll get a CVS export and a link to an online report where you can view all the analytics.

You can do Maze testing in six main steps:

1. Building a prototype
2. Drafting the test plan
3. Recruiting test participants
4. Performing the test
5. Documenting the results
6. Correcting issues

You should to the testing before the product has fully formed, using the wireframes or partially developed app. The primary purpose is to test the concept and build upon the initial framework. By doing that you’re saving time and money because you can do necessary iterations relatively quickly. You can test any flow, as long as you’re able to explain the requirements to the participants.

**Things to keep in mind:**

- **You should have consistent information on all screens (names, phone numbers, payment amounts, language, etc.).**
- Make realistic prototype screens with the information the real user would have (don’t put just one obvious item or too many options to choose from in a screen).
- Try to have working links for all of the buttons that are usually clickable.

###Making your Maze

Paste the link to your prototype, name your new project and start creating your ﬁrst Maze project.

Now start adding blocks!

###Missions

- You are creating the path through which the user has to go to complete the mission.
- There can be one or more paths to completing the mission.

###Questions

- Opinion scale, multiple-choice, open questions, etc.
- You can edit the details for all of them

- Publish your Maze live

###Important details

- Always make a copy of your maze before publishing it!
- Give a short intro about the project - it’s easier to test if users have some context.
- Try to mix up the questions, so they don’t get bored easily.
- It’s good to have a few questions (yes/no, opinion scale, etc.) after every mission to get more info about how users think and why they do something.

###Analyze the findings

- Summarizing and organizing the results is one of the most important steps
- Don’t rush and double-check the prototype for errors.
- Don’t assume users will behave in certain way.

###Info that you can get from Maze

- Direct success, indirect success and bounce rate on each mission.
- Heat maps
- Clicks (also ﬁltered by 1st, 2nd, 3rd…) and areas of your choice.
- Time spent on a single mission.
- Feedback on questions.
- Misclick rate.
- Individual user behaviour.
