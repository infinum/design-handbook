You probably filled out your fair share of surveys. You remember an endless list of questions staring back at you, waiting for you to click the smallest dot in the world that would indicate if you agree with each and every single one of those statements.

This is why we use Typeform. It makes filing out surveys as easy as it could be – given you’re still filling out surveys, not enjoying a Mimosa in Vegas’ Dome.

You’ll find credentials in the Design team’s 1Pass vault.

Typeform has a great [help page](https://www.typeform.com/guide/) with detailed instructions so we won’t go into too much detail. 

Instead, we’ll cover some key things you need to know about using Typeform:

- Create your study within the **UX research folder** in Typeform
- Usually, it’s best to start from scratch instead of reusing a previous survey
- Make **all questions required**. When a question is optional, mention that in the question’s text as well
- **Randomize options** unless you have a very strong reason not to do so (e.g., options describe a rising level of something like time spent on social media)
- **Multiple- and single-choice, and ranking questions** are better than open-ended ones
- Pose questions **as short as possible**
- Try to make available options to be of **similar length**
- **Avoid leading and biased questions** unless you have a very strong reason to pursue one specific angle in a question
- You can **recall answers to previous questions by typing @** and then choosing a question, for instance, “How come @favorite brand? Is it your favorite brand?”
- Use **question logic** to ensure participants don’t answer irrelevant questions
- **Customize the link’s share information** such as headline and body copy – avoiding using Typeform’s default copy
- Set to be **notified when someone fills out your survey** – it’ll give you peace of mind about the pace of turnaround
- If you are sending out the survey to the real end users, **add a new template** using the products brand artifacts
