## Versioning

**Figma** autosaves all your work and creates versions on its own, but itâ€™s not so easy to navigate through auto-generated versions. Make sure you **save versions on your own after** finishing a specific task or a chunk of work. Versioning in Figma is as easy as it gets; just click **File â†’ Save to version history** and name it in a way that makes sense and itâ€™s easy to find.

## Ownership

Figma supports permissions at a team, project, and file level, which means we have to make sure all our files exist inside Infinumâ€™s workspace, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.

When you create a new project (and file inside the project), the file ownership is automatically assigned to you. You'll need to the following for the project and each individual file:

1. Click **Share**
1. Invite **Infinum** to the project (or file)
1. After it appears on the list, click the dropdown next to its name and select **Owner**
1. A dialog will pop up, click **Transfer ownership**
1. Repeat this for every file you created.

More on permissions can in [Figma's documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039970673-Permissions-in-teams).


## Privacy

If youâ€™re working on a project where the client does not want anyone from outside of the project team to see the files, select the **Share** option and restrict access to the team members (**Remove team access** option). It is still important that the project is owned by the Infinum account. If the file is in a project that's shared with everyone on the team, then you cannot restrict access to an individual file in that project.
