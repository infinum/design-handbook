You’ll spend a lot of time during a workshop in FigJam. FigJam is Figma’s **digital board** solution. If you used Miro or something similar, you’ll have no problems using FigJam.

Since FigJam features are on par with competitors, its edge, in our case, is the easy **sharing of Figma assets to FigJam and vice-versa**. It makes life easier for both product strategists and designers.

FigJam has a great guide ([LINK](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004362321-Guide-to-FigJam)), so we won’t go into too much detail. 

A few important things about the logistics of FigJam:

- Make sure that the FigJam file you’re creating is within that **project or client’s folder in Figma**. If you’re unsure, ping design team leads to help you out
- **Re-use** as many FigJam template exercises as you can → [FigJam template](https://www.figma.com/file/ih3OpB8A13c9iE40SkLit4/Ultimate-remote-workshop-template?type=whiteboard&node-id=1930%3A5606&t=MufuH9ajSWqbcR3C-1)
- Invite client team members as viewers to the file when it’s ready
- A few minutes before the workshop, turn on the **Open session**
- Be sure to **update access privilege** on a daily basis and be careful sharing an editable link with non-workshop participants or collaborators 

## Most important commands in FigJam

- **Clicking on an avatar** in the top right corner – follow that person on the board
- **S** –  create a sticky note, the third option from the right in the toolbar
- **Shift+s** – create a section that you can shape, great for organizing content
- **E** –  stamps and emoticons that you can use to quickly get feedback from participants
- **cmd/ctrl + d** –  duplicate any element on the board
- **Right-click + “Copy link to”** –  share a link that lands the person on a specific asset within the board
