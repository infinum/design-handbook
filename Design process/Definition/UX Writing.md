## Designing, but with words

A UX writer’s job is to write every piece of text (also called “copy”) in the app or the website in a human-friendly and conversational way. Combined with an appealing design, it provides a delightful and seamless experience to users. Result: achieving the client’s business goals.

“You’re not the user.” - that’s the mantra of a good UX writer. They do user research (usually with a UX researcher in the team) and research the product (e.g., its revenue model and competitors). UX writers need to know the users’ context, how users got to a specific screen, what they’ve seen already, which options we can give users, and which option we want them to choose.

How to recognize a good UX copy? It’s:

- **Clear:** no technical or business jargon, easy to understand for everyone. 
- **Concise:** people mostly scan the text and don’t read it, so the copy needs to be as short as possible. 
- **Useful:** it provides critical information, explains the context, or provides a way out.

## Getting there

Knowing both users, product, and the client doesn’t happen overnight. In most cases, it starts during the [Discovery workshop](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/discovery-workshop). This is where we get to know the client, discuss their overall communication and set the product’s tone and voice (we’ll get to Tone and voice, don’t worry).

Usually, the next step is [creating black and white wireframes](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/definition/wireframes). UX writer creates copy for these screens, and this is the first road-test of tone and voice. Writing the copy this early in design aligns both design and client’s team around the final product’s look and feel. 

We use wireframes for [usability testing](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/discovery/usability-testing). That's how we get authentic feedback to copy from real-life users and catch any problem early on, saving our clients time and money. Using this feedback, we make final tweaks and [finish the whole UI](https://infinum.com/handbook/books/design/design-process/definition/ui-design).

An example of user feedback to our copy. We aimed for a slightly enthusiastic and neutral on funny - serious dimension. It seems we got it right.

After the product’s launch, the UX writer is not done. When new features and screens are added, they make sure the copy is consistent with previous screens while still doing its job, e.g., getting people to sign up for a free trial.

## Tone and voice

Tone and voice define how a digital product talks about topics of interest and how it addresses users. Think about how your mobile banking “talks” differently than Spotify or Wolt.

Usually, we use [Nielsen Norman’s framework](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/#:~:text=Summary%3A%20A%20website's%20tone%20of,formality%2C%20respectfulness%2C%20and%20enthusiasm.) of digital tone and voice. It’s backed by research, and with four main dimensions, it’s easy to understand and define. The tone and voice become part of the client’s brand book, making it easier to have consistent digital communication on all channels.
