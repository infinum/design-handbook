#Designing, but with words

A UX writer’s job is to write every piece of text (also called “copy”) in the app or the website in a human-friendly and conversational way. Combined with an appealing design, it provides a delightful and seamless experience to users. Result: achieving the client’s business goals.

“You’re not the user.” - that’s the mantra of a good UX writer. They do user research (usually with a UX researcher in the team) and research the product (e.g., its revenue model and competitors). UX writers need to know the users’ context, how users got to a specific screen, what they’ve seen already, which options we can give users, and which option we want them to choose.
