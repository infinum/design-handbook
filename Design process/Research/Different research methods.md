Research methods can be divided into two main groups: **generative and evaluative**.

**Generative research methods** are used to gather knowledge: **discover new insights and ideas about business, users and their needs**. These methods are typically conducted early in the design process, before a product or service has been developed, in order to inform the design and development of the product or service. Some examples of generative research methods include [user interviews](https://infinum.com/handbook/product_strategy/user-research/qualitative/user-interviews), [card sorting](https://infinum.com/handbook/product_strategy/user-research/hybrid/card-sorting) or [ethnographic research](https://infinum.com/handbook/product_strategy/user-research/qualitative/contextual-interview-and-field-studies).

**Evaluative research** methods are used to **test and evaluate specific design solutions or prototypes**. These methods are typically conducted later in the design process after a product or service has been developed in order to identify areas for improvement. Some examples of evaluative research methods include usability testing, tree testing, or A/B testing.

Methods can be split among the **quant-qual axis** as well. 

**Quantitative research methods** require a bigger pool of participants (30+) and offer you reliable results. 

**Qualitative research methods** require less participants and go into more depth. You’ll learn more about the why’s of people's behavior. But generalizing your findings is a tricky thing. Your sample will be 5-10 people, so you need to tread lightly when using those insights.

For the purposes of this Handbook, we’ll stick with the qual-quant split. To add some confusion to the mix, in most of the cases — the split is not clear. For example, you can add a qualitative question to find out why participants provided some of the quantitative answers.
