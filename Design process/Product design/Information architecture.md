**Information architecture** is a part of the design process where we define the complete screen flow and necessary information for the new app or a website.

It helps us keep the app simple and structured so that users can navigate through different features easily. Having a defined information architecture before designing screens helps us stay focused on the screen content and elements.

Usually, it overlaps with clients' app/website API or serves as a foundation for creating a future API.

We usually keep system attributes and flowcharts in the same Figma file as the wireframes, for reference.


## System attributes

One of the main benefits of defining information architecture is to have a complete list of necessary information which need to be visible in a single feature or on a screen.

A list of attributes for the Instagram profile feature can include, for example:

- first name
- last name
- Instagram handle
- profile photo
- biography text
- number of followers
- number of following
- edit profile action
- my posts
- tagged photos

The attributes help us remember all the relevant information when we get to design a profile screen.

##  Flowchart

A flowchart is the flow diagram which represents the complete map of an app or a website. That means it precisely shows how screens in the flow are connected. 

We usually create a flowchart for the features based on the previous customer journey map. 

You can draw flowcharts in Figma with the help of the [Autoflow plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733902567457592893/Autoflow).

Each square in a flowchart represents one screen of an app or a website.

You can also have more flowcharts for different use cases. For example, first-time user login will have a different flow than a regular user login.

Flowchart usually helps us sync with the backend team, clients and developers on how to set up the whole system. It is also a good time for them to say if we can organize or connect some features differently.
