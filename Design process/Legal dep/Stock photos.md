## Guidelines for using stock photos in client work

When creating design proposals that require placeholder images, you may use:

- Images already available on the client's websites and social media, ensuring they hold the rights and proper licenses to those assets,
- Free watermarked images from paid services such as [Shutterstock](http://www.shutterstock.com/), or
- Photos from publicly available sources such as [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://pexels.com/), or similar platforms.

Please note that **purchasing photos via the Infinum account is not permitted if these photos are intended for definitive use in client applications or websites**. If we make the purchase, we will own the license, not the client. The license is held by the purchaser, plain and simple.

If you decide to use stock photos for a client project, follow these steps to ensure proper licensing:

1. Obtain client approval for the specific photo(s) that will be used.
2. Determine the necessary license type for the intended use (e.g., web, mobile, print).
3. Assist clients in setting up their own stock service account.
4. Guide clients through the process of purchasing and downloading the licensed photos.

If you plan to use AI-generated assets in your work, check the [AI tools](https://infinum.com/handbook/design/tools/ai-tools#ai-generated-assets) chapter for more information.
