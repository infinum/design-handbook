Effective management of font licenses is crucial for ensuring compliance and protecting both Infinum and its clients from legal issues. It is important to understand the following:

* Licenses are **embedded** in the font files and can be easily checked by type foundries.
* **License type**
    * **Desktop License:** Allows you to install the font on a computer and use it in desktop applications such as Figma or Pages to create documents or designs. Desktop licenses are often tied to the number of users.
    * **Webfont License:** Permits you to embed the font into websites using CSS. Many webfont licenses are priced based on the number of page views the site receives each month. The license should cover the site’s traffic, meaning if the site grows, it will have to be upgraded.
    * **App License:** Needed for embedding fonts in mobile apps or software. Usually, one license per app and/or software is needed, and the license coverage should reflect the anticipated total monthly active users of this specific app or software. Depending on the type foundry, web apps sometimes fall under app licenses, not webfont licenses.
* **Commercial vs. Non-commercial:** Non-commercial use includes personal projects (concept and visual exercises, hobbies, Dribbble shots, etc.), while commercial usage includes profit-driven activities, generally requiring a commercial license to comply with legal standards. Not all open-source fonts are free for commercial use, so always check the licensing.
* **Modifications:** Some licenses prohibit altering the font file itself, but they may allow modifications to the typography in design.
* **Duration of License:** Most font licenses are perpetual, but some might be time-limited.

All in all, **always read the fine print**. Licensing agreements can vary from type foundry to type foundry, even from font to font within the same foundry. 


### **When Clients Provide Fonts from Existing Branding**

When the client has an existing brand, you will encounter two situations:



* **Custom fonts** – created for the client under which they have complete license ownership,
* **Licensed fonts** – acquired from a type foundry.

In both cases—custom-made or licensed fonts—the client must provide the correct license. If the client is unsure about licensing, our team should guide them in obtaining the appropriate license. PMs will collect documentation from the client to confirm they have the necessary font licenses.

Do not install, use, or forward any font files until they are officially provided by the client or a PM. In the meantime, use a commercially free open-source placeholder font and clearly indicate in the Figma file and any related tasks or emails that the proper license and font files are pending, along with any other outstanding decisions or items.

Once obtained, PMs will store all licensing documentation and communications about font usage in the project’s Google Drive folder. The font files should also be archived on Drive to ensure we use only the files provided by the client and not from a third party.

Once the fonts are received, PMs must maintain a record of all licensing documentation and communications about font usage in the project's Google Drive folder. This is essential for managing audits or disputes. Additionally, the font files should be archived in the Drive to ensure that we are using only the files provided by the client and avoiding any third-party sources.

Upon offboarding, remove the font from your computer after confirming it's stored in the project's Drive folder. This ensures compliance, proper license management, and a smooth transition for the next designer.


### **When Joining an Ongoing Project**

If the previous designer has rightfully obtained the font files, it is safe to transfer them to you. However, if you’re unsure where the file came from, consult with the Project Manager to confirm whether the client holds the appropriate license and files. Do not download or install any fonts if you don’t have a proper license.


### **When Infinum Provides Branding Services, Including Font Selection**

When suggesting fonts for a new branding, use:



* **Test or trial fonts** from type foundries (e.g., [HotType test fonts](https://hottype.co/test-fonts))
* **Open-source fonts** - Often the preferred option for secondary font, smaller-scale projects, and back-office solutions. Keep in mind not all fonts are free for commercial use - some can be used only for non-commercial purposes, so check the licensing. Some well-regarded open-source font libraries are [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com/), and [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/).
* **[Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/)** - an online service included in Adobe CreativeCloud subscriptions that offers a wide range of fonts. Those with a CC license can access and activate fonts from this extensive library on their computers. Once the font is decided upon, a proper license needs to be purchased.

After selecting a font, identify the appropriate license and assist the client with the purchase. Highlight the importance of proper font licensing and the consequences of using unlicensed fonts. The client must purchase their own font licenses, as the license holder is the one who makes the purchase. If we buy the license, it will belong to us, not the client.

Offer guidance on purchasing and managing licenses if clients decide to handle this independently in the future. Make sure they understand their responsibilities for ongoing license management, including:



* **Scalability:** Determine if the license needs to be upgraded as the user base or company grows.
* **Renewal:** Clarify whether the license is perpetual or requires periodic renewal.

Communicate the final information regarding licenses in written form, ideally through email. Keep the PM in the CC.


### **Font licenses quarterly check**

Every quarter, the designer responsible for font licenses reviews the [Projects Overview table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W064oqJqNAjk89YJkcKAbtvu6Av3MFsZs6JrjhvtKVM/edit?usp=sharing) for any new projects. If new projects are identified, they update the [Font licenses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DmW4-2J23p9RNp_bon7uELPaX8_zu5J/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104146078075868413007&rtpof=true&sd=true) with the relevant project information and create a new sub-task in [this Productive task](https://app.productive.io/1-infinum/tasks/3131271). 

If Infinum is not handling the design work for a project, the PM is assigned to obtain the font and license information. Each person tasked with this needs to update the Font licenses table with all relevant details. Although this information typically remains unchanged from quarter to quarter, any rebranding or design changes affecting the fonts used must be documented.


#### Documenting typography and license information

For projects where Infinum handles the design work, the primary designer must document all typography and licensing information within the design system. This documentation should specify the type of license required (Desktop, Webfont, or App License).

If the fonts used on the project require a license, include a link to a Google Drive folder containing the license and font files. For fonts needing a desktop license, check with the PM before installing the font files to ensure the current license permits it.


### **Be safe out there**

Proper font licensing is not only a legal requirement but also a critical aspect of professional reputation and client relationships. By adhering to these guidelines, Infinum ensures that all font usage in client projects is legally compliant and ethically managed.
