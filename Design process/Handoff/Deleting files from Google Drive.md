It might sound trivial at first, but we need to explain it because one (crucial) part of Google Drive has bad UX â€” if you remove anything from a shared folder, you might create a mess. Please be careful.
If you don't have space on your Google Drive, ping your Team Lead, who will probably suggest that you either ask Tanja to increase your Google Drive storage or 
transfer the folder ownership to someone else (TL, PM, or Tanja).

## Increase Google Drive storage
If you and your TL choose this option â€” let Tanja know that you need more space on your Drive. She'll click some buttons, and in a few minutes, you'll have more storage space.

## Transfer ownership

Files inside a folder don't belong to the folder owner; they belong to the person who uploaded it. If you decide to go this route, you have two options:

1. Transfer individual files inside a folder by yourself,
2. Ask Tanja Bulbuk to transfer the whole folder (and its files) for you.

Of course, the second option seems faster at first glance, but it might be quicker to do it yourself if the folder or project doesn't have a lot of files.


### Transfer everything by yourself

If you decide to transfer the project yourself, you will need to transfer files folder by folder, file by file.
Go to the folder you want to remove from your Drive and move to the most rooted folder. Select the files and right-click on them. Click on Share and give an Owner role to the person you want (in this case, PM).

ðŸ“¼ [Follow these video instructions to transfer ownership to someone.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrT0x06LN3b-j31sjCIQABS5T84q9l6w/view?usp=sharing) Go to the parent folder and repeat the procedure.

**Important:** You need to transfer ownership for every file and folder. That means you shouldn't be the owner of any folder or file.
In the end, it should look like this:

![](/img/organization-drive-del1.jpg)

Now you can access these files, but they are not taking space on your Drive.
If you want to remove them entirely; After you transferred ownership of each file and folder. Go outside of the main folder right-click on it. Click **Share**, and under your profile, click **Remove**.
