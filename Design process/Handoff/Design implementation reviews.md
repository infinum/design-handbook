The beginning of the development marks the beginning of the design reviews. Review design early and often.

Sit down with the developer, open the design project, and write down the corrections in the comments while explaining to the developer the reasons for corrections (so the developer can learn how to understand the design better and be able to catch all nuances of the design). Follow up on the implementation of the corrections in the next design review.

Sometimes the design reviews may be frustrating because of the slow implementation of the past reviews, but it is crucial to keep on. Remember, there might be higher priority issues; in the end, itâ€™s all about collaboration.
