During the classic discovery phase, we make a great effort to learn as much possible about the project requirements, the area of interest and the customers. Design Sprint is just an altered version of this much longer and broader discovery process.

A design sprint is a condensed, more focused approach we use to  design digital products with our clients.

It's a two-week process which consists of 3-5 day intensive workshop with the clients and another week reserved for designing a prototype and testing its usability and purpose with the users.

Why choose a design sprint as a way of work:

- It is a faster process (but not cheaper, because more people are involved).
- The outcome is a concept prototype of key features tested out with users in just two weeks.
- The team participates with more focus, and valuable discussions cross out invalid hypotheses, moving the project in the right direction.
- The whole team is on the same page about the project and its goals after the workshop.
- The structure and tools we use in the sprint help us think in various directions and ideate more before deciding on the preferred direction.

We use design sprints for:

- new mobile or web app projects (but not landing pages or websites)
- ideating new features in long-term projects
- redesign of a mobile or web app

As well as it's important to set the project in the right direction, a sprint also creates a valuable friendly bond in the team.
