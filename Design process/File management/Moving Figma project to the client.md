## We have three options for moving
- **Transfer project through Figma** - the fastest solution is done by one of our Infinum Figma admins
- **Transfer file by file** - migrated files with preserved library connections
- **Export files** - you will lose library connections, and you need to export files one by one

### Transfer project through Figma

This particular option is only available to **Organization** and **Enterprise accounts**. If the client has a Professional account, then they won't be able to use it.

- Ask the client for the Figma URL of their workspace and the email of their Figma admin. Offer support to help them find the URL through a short call if needed. Instructions on how to find the Figma URL file (section: When receiving a project) can be found [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/10250387712407-Transfer-a-project-or-team-to-a-different-company#h_01HC0PJ484S46VNCT31KX3J7Y7)
- Once we have this information, ping one of the Infinum Admins (Design TLs or Director)
- Our Infinum admin will then initiate the process, and the Figma admin from the client's side will receive an email about the transfer and accept it. Instructions on how to send a transfer request can be found [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/10250387712407-Transfer-a-project-or-team-to-a-different-company#h_01HC0PJ484S46VNCT31KX3J7Y7) (section: Send a transfer request)

The whole process can be completed in just 10 minutes if we have all the necessary information.

### Transfer file by file

Works for all types of accounts: **Professional, Organization** and **Enterprise.**

- Ping one of the Infinum Admins (Design TLs or Director) and inform them that we will go with this version of the transfer.
- Ask the client to add accounts.figma@infinum.hr to their account as an editor
- Once they do that, the Infinum Figma admin will jump on a quick call with the client.
- On that call, we will ask the client where exactly they want us to transfer the files. When we get that information, we will start moving them one by one.
- To move the files, right-click on the file and pick "Move file..." Once the modal is opened, you need to find the client team and project where you need to move the file. Repeat this with all project files.
- After that, go to the client environment and project where you moved the files and transfer ownership of each file to the client. Right-click "Share" on a dropdown, and select the "owner" on the client account.
- That's it! The client can now leave or remove anyone they want from the project.
