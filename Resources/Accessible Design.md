Accessibility is a vital aspect of designing and developing digital products, as it fosters inclusivity for individuals with disabilities, ensuring that everyone can participate fully in the digital world.

Read more about the initiative in [this blog post](https://infinum.com/blog/digital-product-accessibility/), where we reveal other reasons why accessibility is important, how we initiated the accessibility initiative within the company, how we structured our work, and which established guidelines we adopted.

As our world becomes increasingly digitized, the significance of building accessible digital products has never been more important. Accessibility ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can access, understand, and navigate digital content with ease. This inclusion is not just a matter of compliance or social responsibility; it's a fundamental aspect of creating a product that truly serves the widest possible audience.

In [this blog post](https://infinum.com/blog/best-practices-accessibility-design/), Ana Valjak shared her tips for designing with accessibility in mind.

To ensure that the digital products delivered by Infinum incorporate accessibility principles at every stage of the product design and development lifecycle, we’ve created the [Accessibility Handbook](https://infinum.com/handbook/accessibility).

Its [design chapter](https://infinum.com/handbook/accessibility/design/intro) elaborates on the adapted WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) principles, providing examples of both compliance and non-compliance with the WCAG’s 
Level A. WCAG is a set of guidelines created by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.

Level A is the first level of accessibility and its criteria are essential for every website or app. If your product doesn’t conform with WCAG Level A, it may have serious accessibility issues that prevent users with disabilities from using it.

In its [Accessibility review chapter](https://infinum.com/handbook/accessibility/design/accessibility-review), we explain the best practices for reviewing products, especially highlighting the importance of periodically reviewing the product’s accessibility to catch possible issues that may have occurred during the development phase.

Additionally, we came up with [a list of useful plugins and tools](https://infinum.com/handbook/accessibility/design/useful-plugins-and-tools) to supercharge your accessibility workflow.

Emanuel Loborec brought out the importance of Accessibility closer to the audience at Infinum Talks in [Ljubljana](https://infinum.com/events/on-the-edge-of-ux/) and [Podgorica](https://infinum.com/events/design-talks-podgorica/).

Feel free to check out our [Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1162686263875105735) Figma Community file, where we show an overview of our guidelines along with the Checklist Template.
Come along for the journey and start building with digital product accessibility in mind to create solutions that are truly every-user-friendly.
